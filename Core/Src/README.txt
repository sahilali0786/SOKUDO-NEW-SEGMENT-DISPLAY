/****************************** Code Generation ********************************/
Generate the new project. 
initializing the peripheral that are going to be use in this project.

1. TIM2-CH3 :- This peripheral we are using for Data capture from motor Controller.
               Data like (Speed,motor fail,throttle fail,ECU Fail).
               
2. ADC1     :- This peripheral are using for voltage calibration. we are using this
               to save the odo meter.

3. GPIO     :- This are using for input and output LED sensing and other.

4. FDCAN    :- This peripheral are using For retreive data from FDCAN.
 


/****************************** include Files ********************************/
include 1 wire Communication file.
display driver files.


/****************************** Display Driver ********************************/
Working on Display Driver Files.
instead of using hex now we are doing the bit shift process.
